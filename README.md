Already performed the setup? [‚è© Jump to instructions for **Running the scraper**.](#running-the-scraper)

## System requirements

- **Python 3.** Download and install the latest version of Python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- **Git.** Download and install Git here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/

## Setup

Open a command line. On a Mac, you can use the `Terminal` app.

To run a command, type or copy and paste the listed incantation into your command line, then press Enter (or Return).

In the `Terminal` app, navigate to your desktop:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
```

Download the scraper code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datamade/block-club-election-night.git
```

Navigate into the directory containing the scraper code:

```bash
cd block-club-election-night
```

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the scraper:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/elections
source ~/.virtualenvs/elections/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the scraper

First, navigate into the directory containing the scraper code and activate your virtual environment. If you just finished setup, above, you can skip this step!

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/block-club-election-night
source ~/.virtualenvs/elections/bin/activate
```

Run the scraper:

```bash
python3 -m election_night.get_results
```

You should see something like this in your terminal:

```
OrderedDict([('contest_code', 0), ('race_name', 'Totals'), ('precincts_total', 1291), ('precincts_reporting', 1), ('vote_for', 1)])
```

This indicates the scrape ran successfully!

You can view the output in the `results/` folder. Output files are grouped in a sub-folder named for the date and time you ran the scrape.
